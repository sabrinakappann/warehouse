My first Spring project of a stock / warehouse.
With the objective of create new items composed by this same stock items, I am using the composite design pattern to with a few modifications.

The goal is also ensure the quality of the project by making tests.

PLANING (beeing increasing and updating by the time):
- (OK) Create the princial models related to composite pattern and its tests, to remember basics of OOP
- Be able to acess a home page listing all of my products 
  - (if possible, already on DB. Otherwise, in memory to learn some more things)
- Insert anotations of spring, transforming the models, also, in Entities
- We'll see...
