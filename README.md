My first Spring project of a stock / warehouse.
With the objective of create new items composed by this same stock items, I am using the composite with a few modifications.

The goal is also ensure the quality of the project by making tests.

PLANING (beeing increasing and updating by the time):
-> Create the models and its tests, to remember basics of OOP
-> Insert anotations of spring, transforming the models, also, in Entities
-> Create tests for the entities (to also learn more about them)
