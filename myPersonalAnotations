DTO -> transfer data between controllers and service (no acess to DB)
Entities -> used by services to acess/controll data

MVC Template Engine vs WebServices:

    MVC Template Engine:
        requisitions -> controllers -> ... -> server itself returns html pages with the data (ex: JSP)

    WebServices :
        Browser responsable for set up pages (HTML, CSS, JS) -> Browser only the structured data to mount pages
        SPA (Single Page Application)
        Server only returns data structure (example: JSON)
        Rest Controllers:
            WebServices controllers pattern
            Same prefix for paths, actions defined by http method
            POST != PUT -> POST always add a new, put can update

    Resources = REST Controllers
